# allianz
Challenge number 1 for Allianz

## Prerequisites
Since this is a Vagrant configuration, to test this you need to have Vagrant installed.

## Running
You can run this simply as
**vagrant up**
This will start 5 virtual nodes in 2 Datacenters.
There will be 3 nodes in one datacenter (everything on one rack for simplicity) and 2 nodes in the other (one rack as well). There will be one cassandra seed in each datacenter.
